Tried to repeat a group project from a hackathon

I have created the slave and master side board using PSoC 4 for a game that flashes sequences of LEDs that the
player needs to repeat. The game starts by flashing one of four LEDs. If the player repeats the sequence
by pressing the button corresponding to the LED that was flashed, the game then flashes the same LED
followed by a second LED. The player has to then press the correct 2 button sequence. Then the game will
add a third LED to the sequence and so on until the player either doesnâ€™t repeat the sequence correctly
or the maximum sequence length has been reached.
The maximum sequence length can be adjusted by the master while the speed at which the game flashes
the LEDs can be adjusted by the slave.
As you complete various sections of the game you must test and demonstrate its operation to one of the
course instructors.
